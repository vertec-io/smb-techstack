# Small-to-Medium Business (SMB) Technology Stack - The Background

### Introduction

In the software and tech industry, the term "tech stack" refers to a set of key technologies that enable quick development, iteration, and deployment of applications. Well-known tech stacks, such as the LAMP or MEAN stack, have become industry standards, and professionals generally understand what they encompass.

However, the concept of a tech stack can also extend more broadly beyond the realm of software development. For Small-to-Medium Businesses (SMBs), a tech stack represents a cohesive and well-defined set of technologies that support various aspects of business operations, from IT infrastructure to manufacturing and engineering.

This project aims to curate an optimized ready-to-implement tech stack for SMBs, inspired in part by the philosophy and mental model of Kent C. Dodds' "Epic Stack." The [Epic Stack](https://www.epicweb.dev/epic-stack) is an opinionated and specific set of technologies designed to help developers overcome analysis paralysis. It serves as both a starter kit and a reference implementation, providing solid opinions on the technologies to use for building web applications.

The idea behind the Epic Stack resonates with the challenges faced by SMBs. Entrepreneurs often find themselves overwhelmed by the multitude of technology choices, leading to indecision and delays. The SMB Stack aims to provide a ready-to-deploy template that aligns with key business metrics, allowing entrepreneurs to focus on their core mission without getting bogged down in technology decisions.

### Reference Articles 
We searched online to see if anything like this had already been established and found several interesting articles noting the importance of a tech stack in SMBs. What we found, however, was a lack of concrete guidance on implementing a tech stack for SMBs. While many articles discuss the categories of technologies required and some even list specific technologies, none provide a ready-to-implement tech stack. We hope the SMB Stack fills this role.

### The SMB Stack Concept

The SMB Stack follows a similar approach to [Kent C. Dodds' "Epic Stack"](https://www.epicweb.dev/epic-stack). The primary goal of the SMB Stack is to help your company get over analysis paralysis by giving you solid opinions for technologies to use to build your business. The SMB stack serves two purposes:

- **A SMB Starter:** A foundational template for entrepreneurs.
- **A Reference Implementation:** A guide to best practices and integration.

Most entrepreneurs don't start with a clear plan for the technologies they will use to build their business, nor do they have the time to focus on these decisions. Their critical choices revolve around their product or service, not the technical details like on-site servers vs. the cloud, or ERP systems.

Entrepreneurs shouldn't agonize over technology decisions or worry about future compatibility and scalability. They shouldn't stress about overspending on solutions that exceed their current needs.

The SMB Stack aims to provide a starter tech stack that entrepreneurs can confidently implement. It's designed to work equally well for a one-person operation or a 200-employee company, without being overwhelming or excessively costly.
