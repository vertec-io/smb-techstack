# Why ProxMox

Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE) can be effectively used in a company with 100-200 employees. It's a robust and flexible virtualization solution that can handle various workloads, from virtual desktops to application servers. Here's why Proxmox might be a suitable choice for a company of this size:

## Backup and Disaster Recovery: 
Proxmox includes built-in backup and snapshot capabilities, essential for protecting critical business data and applications.
