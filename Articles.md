## SMB Tech Stack Articles

This is a compiled grouping of articles related to the tech stacks of SMBs. An interesting and recurring theme in all of these articles is they discuss the importance of SMB's having a tech stack. Some even talk about the categories of technologies required in a tech stack. Only a few actually list specific technologies in the tech stack. But none of these actually put together a concrete tech stack that can be implemented. This is what this repo project is trying to do. Rather than merely writing about the concept of a tech stack, or the types of technologies needed in a tech stack in the modern era, we aim to list out the technologies specifically as a read-to-deply template.

We follow a similar mental model behind Kent C. Dodds' "Epic Stack" (https://www.epicweb.dev/epic-stack). Like the Epic Stack, the SMB Stack is opinionated and specific. The primary goal of the SMB Stack is to help your team get over analysis paralysis by giving you solid opinions for technologies to use to build your business. The SMB Stack is really two things:

A SMB starter
A reference implementation

Most entrepreneurs don't start a new business with a clear implementation of what technologies they will use to build their business. Nor do they have the time to focus their time and energy into making these decisions. The important decisions are those regarding their product or service, not weigh the pros and cons of an on-site server vs. the cloud, or some optimized combination of the two. Entrepreneurs shouldn't spend weeks agonizing over which ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system to implement, whether it will work well with their Manufacturing Execution System (MES), and so on. They certainly shouldn't spend needless time worrying about whether the technology decision they make today will work with them once they grow in people, revenue, and customers or if they'll need to throw the whole thing away and overhaul it next year. They shouldn't stress about spending too much on a solution that is bigger than they can reasonably utilize in the short-to-medium term, wasting money buying the Ferrari of ERP's hoping they'll grow into it eventually. Entrepreneurs should be able to implement a reference a starter tech stack that they can be confident will work as well when they're one-man show as when they manage 200 employees, and everything in between, and that it won't be too much for them to take on and learn to get moving right away.
