# Small-to-Medium Business (SMB) Technology Stack 

## Introduction

The smb-techstack repository is dedicated to providing a comprehensive and optimal technology stack for small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) operating in the US. This effort targets companies ranging from 1 to 200 people and revenue from \$0 to $##. The repository serves as a ready-to-use template architecture that can be quickly implemented by SMBs so that they can focus on their core mission. By eliminating the need for significant resource allocation towards technology infrastructure, this template empowers SMBs to grow quickly, confidently, and efficiently.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to identify and document technology solutions that align with the following key metrics:

- **Cost (Medium-to-Long Term):** Focus on value over the medium-to-long term by leveraging open-source, high-efficiency, and affordable technology solutions. The aim is not merely to find the cheapest option but to identify solutions that meet the needs of the SMB with room to grow.

- **Quality:** Emphasize quality over cost. Poor quality hardware and software can lead to higher costs in the medium to long term due to troubleshooting and maintenance. The selected solutions should be reliable and robust.

- **Skills:** The technology stack should be accessible to employees without requiring significant technical skills. It should be easy to find employees with experience in the tech stack components or ensure that the technology is intuitive and easy to learn. The skills gained should be transferable and attractive to individuals seeking career growth.

- **Growth:** The chosen technologies should support significant growth without the need for frequent repurchasing, replacement, or overhauling. They should be seen as key initial investments that enable the company to expand with minimal resources allocated to maintenance and upgrades.
