Small-to-Medium Business (SMB) Technology Stack

## Purpose

The goal for this document is to identify an optimal technology stack for small to medium sized businesses (SMB) operating in the US. An SMB for the purposes of this effort can be considered a company of 1-200 people, and or $0 - $## in revenue. 

The key metrics being optimized are as follows:

- Cost (Medium-to-Long Term): Keep operating costs as low as possible by leveraging open source (where applicable), high efficienc, and affordable technology solutions. Optimizing for affordable software/hardware does not mean purchasing the cheapest option necessarily. The goal is to optimize for best value over the medium-to-long term, where the solution being offered adequately meets the needs of the SMB with room to grow over the medium to long term before any significant repurchase/replacement/upgrade is required.
  
- Quality: SMB's have little time and resources and should not choose poor quality hardware and software solely for the sake of cost and sacrifice quality. These types of decisions often will produce a higher cost over the medium to long-term, as troubleshooting poor quality solutions

- Skills: Employees working for the SMB's must not require significant technical skill to utilize the technologies at the SMB. It should be easy to hire employees with previous experience in the tech stack components, or the tech stack should be intuitive and easy to learn. Additionally, the skills gained by employees should be attractive to individuals seeking to improve their technical capabilities, and transfer those skills to other companies, industries, and career paths. Employees should feel that by learning the tech stack used at the SMB, they are learning highly coveted and transferrable skills accross one or many industries.

- Growth: The technology solutions should enable significant growth for the company and limit the need to repurchase, replace, and overhaul the technology stack throughout the 1-200 person and $0 - $## revenue growth period. These technologies should be seen as key initial investments that enable the company to grow quickly, confidently, and efficiently with minimal resource allocation needed to maintain, upgrade, and reevaluate the business infrastructure.
